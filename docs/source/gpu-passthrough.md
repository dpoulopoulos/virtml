# GPU Passthrough using VFIO

This guide will show you how to pass through a GPU to a Virtual Machine (VM) on KVM. This is useful
for creating a VM that will become a Kubernetes GPU worker.

ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§ This is Work-in-Progress. ðŸš§ ðŸš§ ðŸš§

## What you'll need

* A Debian-based system.
* A working [QEMU/KVM installation](qemu-kvm).

## Step 1: Set your Primary Display for the Host

This step is necessary to change the primary display to the integrated GPU leaving the dedicated GPU
free to be used by the VM.

### What you'll need

* Access to the BIOS settings of your computer.

### Procedure

1. Change to root user:

    ```console
    user:~$ sudo su -
    root:~#
    ```

1. Create a configuration file to instruct the X server to use the integrated GPU:

    a. Run the following command:

    ```console
    root:~# cat > /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/intel.conf
    ```

    b. Copy and paste the following text:

    ```
    Section "Device"
        Identifier "Intel"
        Driver "intel"
        BusID "PCI:0:2:0"
    EndSection
    ```

    Replace `PCI:0:2:0` with the BusID of your integrated GPU. You can find it by running
   `lspci | grep VGA`.
    
    c. Run `CTRL + D` to exit.

1. Boot to UEFI/BIOS settings, and set the primary display to the integrated GPU. Look under
   "Advanced" settings, for an option like "Primary Display". Set it to "Auto" and connect the
   monitor directly to the motherboard. Alternativelly, set it to "CPU" or "iGPU" if available.

    ```console
    root:~# systemctl reboot --firmware-setup
    ```

## Step 2: Enable GPU Passthrough

In this section, you will bind the GPU to the VFIO driver and prevent the Linux Kernel from loading
the NVIDIA driver during boot.

### What you'll need

* A dedicated GPU that is not being used by the host.

### Procedure

1. Get the PCIe ID of the GPU:

    ```console
    root:~# lspci -nn | grep -i nvidia
    01:00.0 VGA compatible controller [0300]: NVIDIA Corporation GA106 [GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate] [10de:2504] (rev a1)
    01:00.1 Audio device [0403]: NVIDIA Corporation GA106 High Definition Audio Controller [10de:228e] (rev a1)
    ```

    The PCIe ID of the VGA controller is `10de:2504` and the Audio device is `10de:228e`. Take a note of these IDs. You will need them later.

1. Chane the `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT` variable in the `/etc/default/grub` file to include the
   following options:

    * `intel_iommu=on`: Enable IOMMU for the integrated GPU.
    * `iommu=pt`: Enable IOMMU passthrough.

    ```console
    root:~# sed -i 's/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="\(.*\)"/GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="\1 intel_iommu=on iommu=pt"/' /etc/default/grub
    ```

1. Update the GRUB configuration:

    ```console
    root:~# update-grub
    ```

1. Create a configuration file to bind the GPU to the VFIO driver:

    a. Run the following command:

    ```console
    root:~# cat > /etc/modprobe.d/vfio.conf
    ```

    b. Copy and paste the following text:

    ```
    options vfio-pci ids=10de:2504,10de:228e
    softdep nvidia pre: vfio-pci
    ```

    Replace `10de:2504,10de:228e` with the PCIe IDs of your GPU.
    
    c. Run `CTRL + D` to exit.

1. Update the initial ramdisk:

    ```console
    root:~# update-initramfs -c -k $(uname -r)
    ```

1. Reboot the system:

    ```console
    root:~# reboot
    ```

### Verify

1. Check if the GPU is bound to the VFIO driver:

    ```console
    root:~# lspci -k | grep -E "vfio-pci|NVIDIA"
    01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation GA106 [GeForce RTX 3060 Lite Hash Rate] (rev a1)
        Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
    01:00.1 Audio device: NVIDIA Corporation GA106 High Definition Audio Controller (rev a1)
        Kernel driver in use: vfio-pci
    ```
