# Kubeflow on KVM

Welcome to the Kubeflow on KVM repository, your go-to resource for deploying Kubeflow on virtual
machines (VMs) managed by Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

Kubeflow on KVM is a project dedicated to simplifying the process of setting up
[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) in a virtualized environment, making it easier for data
scientists to leverage the power of Machine Learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes.

To get started, visit the [Kubeflow on KVM documentation](https://kubeflow-kvm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
