# VirtML

Welcome to the VirtML project repository, your go-to resource for deploying Kubeflow on Virtual
Machines (VMs) managed by Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

VirtML is a project dedicated to simplifying the process of setting up
[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) in a virtualized environment, making it easier for data
scientists to leverage the power of Machine Learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes.

To get started, visit the [VirtML documentation](https://dpoulopoulos.github.io/virtml/).
