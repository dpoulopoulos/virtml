<h3 align="center">ðŸš€ Efficiently deploy Kubeflow on VMs managed by KVM</h3>

---

<br>

Welcome to the VirtML project repository, your go-to resource for deploying Kubeflow on Virtual
Machines (VMs) managed by Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM).

VirtML is a project dedicated to simplifying the process of setting up
[Kubeflow](https://www.kubeflow.org/) in a virtualized environment, making it easier for data
scientists to leverage the power of Machine Learning (ML) workflows on Kubernetes.

Follow the instructions in the [VirtML documentation](https://dpoulopoulos.github.io/virtml/) to set up your first Kubeflow cluster.

### Why VirtML?

In the rapidly evolving landscape of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI), the
ability to swiftly and efficiently deploy scalable and manageable computing resources is paramount.
VirtML embodies this philosophy by leveraging the power of virtualization through Kernel-based
Virtual Machine (KVM) technology, married with the orchestration capabilities of Kubernetes. But why
choose VirtML?

#### âœ… Simplified Kubernetes Deployment

At the heart of VirtML lies a commitment to simplicity and accessibility. Building a Kubernetes
cluster can be daunting. VirtML simplifies this process through the use of Ansible and Kubespray:

- Ansible: An open-source automation tool that automates software provisioning, configuration
  management, and application deployment. With Ansible, VirtML users can effortlessly set up their
  VMs and manage configurations, making the initial steps of deploying Kubernetes clusters as simple
  as running a few commands.

- Kubespray: Built on Ansible, Kubespray provides a reliable and efficient method to deploy a
  Kubernetes cluster. It abstracts the complexity behind setting up a Kubernetes cluster, making it
  accessible even to those who are new to Kubernetes or ML infrastructure.

#### ðŸŒ± Educational Journey

VirtML is not just about deploying ML workflows efficiently; it's also designed as a learning tool.
Through the process of setting up Kubernetes on KVM using Ansible and Kubespray, users gain invaluable
insights into:

- Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Experience firsthand the power of Ansible and Kubespray in
  automating the deployment and management of infrastructure, a key skill in todayâ€™s DevOps
  practices.

- Kubernetes Orchestration: Learn the principles of container orchestration with Kubernetesâ€”managing
  containers, automating deployments, scaling applications, and ensuring high availability.

- Machine Learning Workflows: By setting up your own Kubeflow environment, explore various aspects
  of ML workflows, from data preparation and model training to deployment and scaling.
